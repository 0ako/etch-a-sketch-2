Notes:
- when debugging, and unable to use console.log to verify output (due to the use of functions outputting undefined) then go through every line uninterrupted. 
- each '?' in script.js is a point for me to research and understand

Known issues:
! 'gray' mode resets the gridItem opacity to 0.0 when completely black (check colorGrid case 'gray')
! get that font-face working to display Akaya Telivigala
! get comfortable with switch statements syntax
